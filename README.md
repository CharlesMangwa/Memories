Memories
========

Memories is an idea which was born in the mind of 5 HETIC's students. During a week, we had to think about a new game based on HTML5/CSS3/JS languages. Thus, Memories is a game which help old people to exercise themselves, and more especially their brain. As a matter of fact, through these games, their doctor can analyze their results and see if they resent any sign of Alzheimer. Thus, Memories is an "Alzheimer preventer tool".
